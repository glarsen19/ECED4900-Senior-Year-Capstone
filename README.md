# ECED4900-Senior-Year-Capstone
Repository for our senior year Capstone project, focused on designing, fabricating, and testing a new micro-machined imaging transducer.

Initial scope of project:
Focus on designing, fabricating, and testing a new micro-machined imaging transducer using a fancy new pico-second laser system. The goal would be to machine the ultrasound wafer into a micro-matrix of piezo material and epoxy such that it looks acoustically transparent to a therapeutic transducer located behind your imaging transducer. There would be design component, micro-fabrication component and a characterization (electrical/acoustic measurements etc).
